            The Wild Card option is the most uniqe of all the factions. It sees the player taking control of a plot to undermine Mr. House's rule
            of the strip, and ultimately taking control of the strip and the wasteland for themselves. This gives this option alot of variability,
            as it gives the players actions direct influence of the future of the Mojave. Often, it's refered to as the "Independent Vegas" option,
            kicking the Legion, NCR, and House out of the picture, and leaving them to their own devices. While I think this route has conceptual issues,
            I think it's the best and most free option for the Mojave.
