            I will be blunt, I belive Ceasar's Legion is objectively evil. The few proponents of the Legion will point to facts like
            caravans being safe in Legion territiory, but it's a weak argument for a dictatorship. The Legion is a society built upon 
            the conquest and enslavement of 19 tribes. The dictator, Ceasar, sees himself rebuilding the Roman Empire, though the extent
            of his knowledge is based upon the few surviving history books. The Legion are facist, dictatorial, oppresive slavers, and they have 
            no place creating a future for the Mojave.
