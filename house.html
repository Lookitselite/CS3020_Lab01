        <h1>Fallout: New Vegas</h1>
        <h2>Mr. House</h2>

            Of the Factions of New Vegas, Mr. House is the most interesting. He originates from the pre-war times, being the CEO of RobCo, 
            and proprieter of the Strip. By using advanced pre-war technology, he's extended his life by hundreds of years, influencing the 
            outside world via the use of a network of robots. He's returned the Las Vegas Strip to it's former glory, and he wants the same for 
            the rest of the world. A self proclamed autocrat, he seeks progress at any cost, and meets resistance with violent efficiency. On
            the one hand, relentless progress may be what the wasteland needs, but it needs a heart aswell, and House has no emotion to give.
            I belive his ideology is well thought, but flawed, his relentless pursuit of progress and capital surely coming at the expense of 
            those in his way.
