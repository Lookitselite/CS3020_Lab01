            New Vegas is one of my favorite video games of all time. In my opinion, it is the the best possible balance of RPG story mechanics,
            punchy FPS gameplay, and open world exploration. As Fallout goes, the game is set in a post nuclear war world of scorched landscapes 
            and mutated life, now in the region of the Mojave Desert. As any great RPG should, the game asks a multitude of toughtful questions,
            frequently revolving around ethics, society, and political structure. Many people to this day question which faction is in the "right", 
            or if there even is a "right" answer to the games questions. So for this assignment, I thought I would give some insight into the 
            main factions of New Vegas, their ideology, and my opinion on them. But as a teaser, I'll give a ranked list of the factions I think
            are best for the Mojave.
