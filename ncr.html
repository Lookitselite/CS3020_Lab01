            The New California Republic, or NCR, is an infamous faction of the Fallout series, being present in the original games (Though, I've 
            never played the original two games). The NCR has a striking resemblance to the US government, a democratic republic who on the 
            surface, seem to be the simple good guys, and in many ways they are. The NCR grants rights to its citizens, including mutated humans 
            such as ghouls and super mutants. Their citizens see good living standards for the wasteland, often having access to clean water, food,
            and disposable income. However the NCR also is heavily flawed, mired in bueraucracy, corruption, and overextension. The elite of their 
            government often protects the intrest of the wealthy over those of the poor, and despite claimed rights, the NCR Military has perpetrated
            human rights abuses, such as the massacre at Bitter Springs, or the harrassment of peaceful super mutant communities. The most scathing 
            criticism of the NCR is the fact that, at least in the universe of Fallout, their style of democracy and government lead to the end of the 
            world. With heavy influence from the player, many of their issues in the Mojave can be pushed in the right direction, but ultimately I
            don't belive the NCR is the correct path for the Mojave. While not outright evil, I cannot say they are a good option.
